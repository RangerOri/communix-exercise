# communix-exercise

This exercise was created by the Communix company.
The goal is to adjust the Bricks game.
To showcase a flow from a firebase project towards gameplay, changing text in runtime via a remote json file update.


## Prerequisites

* Unity
* Firebase RemoteConfig
* Firebase Storage

## Usage

Two scenes are in the game.
Menu, Game
The RemoteConfig changes the text in the Menu scene.

## Deployment

Make sure everything is ready before running, the github repo holds the JSON lib, but none of the firebase packages.

### Also

It was quite fun!
