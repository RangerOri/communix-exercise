# communix-exercise

This exercise was created by the Communix company.\
The goal is to adjust the Bricks game and to showcase a flow from a firebase project towards gameplay, changing text in runtime via a remote json file update.


## Prerequisites

* Unity
* Firebase RemoteConfig
* Firebase Storage

## Usage

Two scenes are in the game:\
Menu, Game\
The JSON data changes the text in the Menu scene through async task.\

## Deployment

The github repo holds the JSON lib, but none of the firebase packages, only the google-services.json.

### Also

It was quite fun!
